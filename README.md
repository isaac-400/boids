# boids

An implementation of the "boids" algorithm from the paper _Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model_ by Craig Reynolds.
It uses the simple graphics library cs1lib.py (backed by PyQt5) and collisions are calculated with a quadtree. Made by Isaac Feldman (isaac.c.feldman.23@dartmouth.edu).
